## About The Project
This repository documents my personal learning journey in Scrum. It includes:
- A somewhat structured breakdown of Scrum methodology
- Practical examples of backlog refinement and sprint execution
- Personal reflections on working with Scrum and agile development
---
## Scrum Overview
### What is Scrum?
Scrum is an agile methodology designed to help teams efficiently develop products through **short iterations called Sprints**

### What is a Scrum Sprint?

A limited period of time (1-4 weeks) where the team selects user stories from the product catalog, develops them, and delivers a finished product. The product is presented to the Product Owner during a Sprint Review.

---
## Assignment 1: Explain the different steps in a Scrum Sprint

## Scrum Process

### **1. Sprint Planning**
This is a guideline, but do have in mind, all workplaces can look different depending on needs and corporate culture

**Participants that are present dring the Spring Planning**

- The Product Owner - Presents the Product Backlog and prioritizes User Stories
- The Scrum Master - Facilitates the meeting and ensures that the Scrum principles are followed
- The Development Team - Estimates the workload and discusses whether its realistic goals to achieve.

**The Planning Meeting**

A planning meeting takes place where it is discussed on what will be worked on during a particular sprint, one could think:

What should we build?
- Pick out the most crucial user stories and set a goal (Sprint Goal), made by the “Product Owner”, but in a large way the team decides what is realistic to achieve, it is a collaboration between both parties. These user stories falls under the Product Backlog.

How should we build it? 

- Break down user stories into smaller tasks, this is known now as "tasks"
- The sprint is based on the User Stories that are selected, these are entered into a so-called “Sprint Backlog”
- The tasks have an order of priority
- Its crucial that everone on the team has a clear vision/understanding of the challenges

**Sprint Goal**
- As the title says, what does the team want to achieve during the particular sprint (Sprint Goal)
- This is a important aspect, the team gets a clear direction on whats needs to be done during the sprint
- Discussions about whats actually reallisticly to achieve under the sprint
- Both Product Owner and the team agrees on one sprint goal
- Setting a Sprint Goal also helps the team with structure and avoid unnecessary work.


### **2. Sprint Execution**

- The team starts working on the tasks that have been selected that now are in the Sprint Backlog.
- The goal is to deliver a working part of the product by the end of the sprint.

**Daily Stand Ups**
- Every day, smaller meetings are held for about 15 minutes
- The purpose is to synchronize the work with each other and identify potential obstacles.
- You usually ask yourself the questions in a structured way:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What should I do today?
- Are there any obstacles?
- Generally, you work independently and take responsibility but collaborate when necessary.

**Scrum Master**
- Doesnt control the meeting, but is there as an asset for the team
- Sees obstacle and prevents them from happening, things that can slow down the team
- Keeps the team focused on the objective and prevents distractions
- Secures that the Scrum principles are followed 

**Overall**
- Team members usally works independently.
- Takes responsibility and pride in the tasks.
- Team members collaborates if needed to secure a smooth development.
- The Scrum Master supports the team.

### **3. Sprint Review**

- When the sprint has reached its end date, the team presents what has been built to the product owner.
- Feedback is collected and any adjustments are made after testing what has been presented.


### **4. Sprint Retrospective**

When the sprint is completed, its essential and a good opportunity to reflect overall on how it went.

You have now the possibility to question yourselfs
- What went well?
- What went less well?
- What can we learn from this print and apply it into the next sprint?

This is a great way to improve
- Productivity
- A greater team-morale
- Quicker problem solving before the next sprint
- Greater teamwork, better understanding of the team members

## Scrum concepts that are good to know

- User stories - These are a short description of a functionality from the perspective of the user.

  You can think it in this context: As a user I want to be able to login with FaceID so i can access my bankaccounts.

  The format follows: As [role] i want to be able to [functionality] so i can [goal]

 - Sprints
 
  A time period where the team works developing a certain functionality/feature of the product.

- Story points

  A measuring unit to decide how complex and how long a User Story can be.

- Definition of Done

  This is a checklist requirements, it can look different for each workplace, it can consist of:
  
  - Code is reviewed and approved
  - There are no critical bugs
  - The code / feature are following quality standards
  - Not half finished (fully completed)

## Assignment 2: How was the process with creating/prioritizing user stories?, what could have went better?

We where given a task to make a "mock" app with a design in Figma(Pawfect-Furfriends) and this is how it went:

### Reflection of creating and prioritizing User Stories

When we where given the task, we the team immediately starting to brainstorm, a lot of great ideas came forward

The ideas was the start, soon enough we broke them all down to User Stories according to the needs of the user.

To prioritise the users most important features we decided to apply the "Moscow principles" which follows
- Must haves (Critical features for the product to work, registration and login)
- Should haves (Important secondary features as, being able to see lists of allergies/vaccinations for each dog you have)
- Could haves (A desirable feature, not mandatory as, map of areas to rest your dog)
- Won't haves (Features that are not currently on focus, may be implemented later)

### Things that went great

- Great teamwork
- Everyone put effort
- Communication was a key driven factor
- The majority (85%) of user stories had good descriptions which made it easy to break them down to tasks
- Using Trello

### Things that went less great

- Overloaded Product Backlog from the beginning, to many user stories which led it to be dificult to prioritise.
- The pace was to fast, we where a little too enthusiastic which resulted in rushed completion, we had to make adjustments after feedback.
- Because of an overloaded PB there were som unclear User Stories, some of them lacked clarity leading to misunderstanding
---

## Assignment 3: How do you turn a User Story into a feature? Use an example and define completion

A teamworker picks a User Story from all the many that where in our Product Backlog and puts it in a Sprint Backlog for development

### How we estimated the difficulty 

- Complexity was estimated through discussions and Planning Poker
- Story Points was a great way to rate the level of difficulty before dividing the user story into tasks

### The development process 

- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- In Progress
- In Review
- Done

### Breaking down the User Story into tasks

The User Story:
- As a new user, I want to be able to register an account in the app so i can log in and use the services.

Tasks - UI

Create Activity, includes a layout template (XML)
Use Activity Layout for Name, Email and Password inputs (Edittexts)
