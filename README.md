## About The Project
This repository documents my personal learning journey in Scrum. It includes:
- A somewhat structured breakdown of Scrum methodology
- Practical examples of backlog refinement and sprint execution
- Personal reflections on working with Scrum and agile development
---
## Scrum Overview
### What is Scrum?
Scrum is an agile methodology designed to help teams efficiently develop products through **short iterations called Sprints**

### What is a Scrum Sprint?

A limited period of time (1-4 weeks) where the team selects user stories from the product catalog, develops them, and delivers a finished product. The product is presented to the product owner during a Sprint Review.

---
## Scrum Process

### **1️⃣ Sprint Planning**
This is a guideline, but do have in mind, all workplaces can look different depending on needs and corporate culture

**Participants that are present dring the Spring Planning**

- The Product Owner - Presents the Product Backlog and prioritizes User Stories
- The Scrum Master - Facilitates the meeting and ensures that the Scrum principles are followed
- The Development Team - Estimates the workload and discusses whether its realistic goals to achieve.

**The Planning Meeting**

A planning meeting takes place where it is discussed on what to work on during a particular sprint, one could think:

What should we build?
- Pick out the most crucial user stories and set a goal (Sprint Goal), made by the “Product Owner”, but in a large way the team decides what is realistic to achieve, it is a collaboration between both parties. These user stories falls under the Product Backlog.

How should we build it? 

- Break down user stories into smaller tasks, this is known now as "tasks"
- The sprint is based on the User Stories that are selected, these are entered into a so-called “Sprint Backlog”
- The tasks have an order of priority
- Its crucial that everone on the team has a clear vision/understanding of the challenges

Sprint Goal
- As the title says, what does the team want to achieve during the particular sprint (Sprint Goal)
- This is a important aspect, the team gets a clear direction on whats needs to be done during the sprint
- Discussions about whats actually reallisticly to achieve under the sprint
- Both Product Owner and the team agrees on one sprint goal
- Setting a Sprint Goal also helps the team with structure and avoid unnecessary work.


### **2️⃣ Sprint Execution**

- The team starts working on the tasks that have been selected that now are in the Sprint Backlog.
- The goal is to deliver a working part of the product by the end of the sprint.

Daily Stand Ups
- Every day, smaller meetings are held for about 15 minutes
- The purpose is to synchronize the work with each other and identify potential obstacles.
- You usually ask yourself the questions in a structured way:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What should I do today?
- Are there any obstacles?
- Generally, you work independently and take responsibility but collaborate when necessary.

Scrum Master
- Doesnt control the meeting, but is there as an asset
- Sees obstacle and prevents them from happening, things that can slow down the team
- Keeps the team focused on the objective and prevents distractions
- Secures that the Scrum principles are followed 

Overall
- Team members usally works independently.
- Takes responsibility and pride in the tasks.
- Team members collaborates if needed to secure a smooth development.
- The Scrum Master supports the team.
