## About The Project
This repository documents my personal learning journey in Scrum. It includes:
- A somewhat structured breakdown of Scrum methodology
- Practical examples of backlog refinement and sprint execution
- Personal reflections on working with Scrum and agile development
---
## Scrum Overview
### What is Scrum?
Scrum is an agile methodology designed to help teams efficiently develop products through **short iterations called Sprints**

### What is a Scrum Sprint?

A limited period of time (1-4 weeks) where the team selects user stories from the product catalog, develops them, and delivers a finished product. The product is presented to the product owner during a Sprint Review.

---
## Scrum Process

### **1️⃣ Sprint Planning**
This is a guideline, but do have in mind, all workplaces can look different depending on needs and corporate culture

**Participants that are present dring the Spring Planning**

- The Product Owner - Presents the Product Backlog and prioritizes user stories
- The Scrum Master - Facilitates the meeting and ensures that the scrum principles are followed
- The Development Team - Estimates the work and discusses whether they are realistic goals to achieve.

**The Planning Meeting**

A planning meeting takes place where it is discussed what to work on during a particular sprint, one could think:

What should we build?
- Pick out the most crucial user stories and set a goal (Sprint Goal), made by the “Product Owner”, but in a large way the team decides what is realistic to achieve, it is a collaboration between both parties. These user stories falls under the Product Backlog.

How should we build it? 
- The sprint is based on the user stories that are selected, these are entered into a so-called “Sprint Backlog”
- Break down user stories into smaller tasks, this is known now as "tasks"
- The tasks have an order of priority
- Its important that everone on the team has a clear vision/understanding of the challenges

### **2️⃣ Sprint Execution**


### **3️⃣ Sprint Review**
### **4️⃣ Sprint Retrospective**
### **✅ Sprint Goal**
